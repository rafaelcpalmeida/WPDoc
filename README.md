# WPDocs

WPDocs is a free and open source WordPress theme for your project documentation.

### Version
1.0.0

### Tech

WPDocs is based on [daux.io] and on [_s] but it was stripped down and personalized as I saw it looked better, altough I'm using their css theme files as base.

### Installation

Just install a fresh copy of WordPress, WPDocs and you're ready to use it.

#### Instructions

I'll fill them here :)

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

If you made changes to the theme base just make a pull request.
