### Version
1.0.0

### Tech

WPDocs is based on [daux.io] and on [_s] but it was stripped down and personalized as I saw it looked better, altough I'm using their css theme files as base, I've created a CSS file with my custom styling.

In order to stylize the code I'm using [prism.js], you can check the languages they support in their page.

### Installation

Just install a fresh copy of WordPress, WPDocs and you're ready to use it.

#### Instructions

- Move WPDocs folder to WordPress themes folder
- Activate WPDocs
- Go to your pages and 
    - Create a new page and choose the "WPDocs Frontpage" template
    - Or edit an existing one and choose the "WPDocs Frontpage" template
- Go to Personalize -> Homepage -> Change homepage to a static page and chose the page you've changed in the step above
- Go to Personalize -> Menus and create a menu to be shown in the bottom of the Homepage and antoher one to be shown on the left side bar on the theme's inner pages
- Create a new page and style the code using &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; tags, for PHP. You can use any language that prism supports.
```
<pre><code class="language-php">
    echo "Hello World\n";
</code></pre>
```

Or

```
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    console.log("Hello World\n");
</code></pre>
```
